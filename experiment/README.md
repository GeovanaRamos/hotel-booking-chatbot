# Experiment

Artifacts generated by the experiment.

## Requirements

1. Suppose you have to make a chatbot to book coworking spaces. Consider the following restrictions:
    - The coworking has individual seats in cubicle and two meeting rooms, one for up to 5 people and one for up to 10 people;
    - The coworking already has a functional API that receives as a parameter a day/time and a request for a cubicle or a request for one of the two rooms. It returns if the cubicle/room is available on that day/time;
2. Model in UPPAAL a conversational flow of a chatbot that makes reservations for this coworking space keeping in mind the above requirements. You are free to enter additional requirements, if you wish, in order to model the conversation flow with the best possible user experience.
3. Finally, use the checker to check some basic properties, such as checking if the chatbot avoids a reservation whenever there is no availability for what the customer requested.
4. Use the base templates of this repository, and evolve from them, following the instructions in the README to open it in UPPAAL.
5. Try for at least 30 minutes. If you haven't finished in that time, you can proceed to the next step or keep trying as long as you wish. If you manage to finish before 30 minutes, no problem.
